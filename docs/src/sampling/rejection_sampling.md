# Rejection sampling method

The **Rejection Sampling** method, or **Acceptance-rejection method,** was proposed by von Neumann (1951). See, for instance, [Liu (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-76371-2) and [Gamerman and Lopes (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781482296426).

## Setting

One considers a univariate random variable $X$ with density $p=p(x)$ under the following assumptions:

1. We may not know the density $p(x)$ but we do know a non-negative function $f(x)$ proportional to the density, with some unknown normalizing constant $Z > 0,$ i.e.
   ```math 
        p(x) = \frac{f(x)}{Z}. 
   ```
2. We know how to sample from another random variable $X'$ with known density $q=q(x)$ which bounds a multiple of the function $f(x)$ with a known bound, i.e. for some known $M>0,$
```math
    f(x) \leq M q(x), \quad \forall x.
```

## The rejection sampling method

Under this setting, we obtain samples of $X$ by sampling from $X'$ and accepting or rejecting the candidate sample according to a specific criteria, and we repeat the process until a candidate is accepted, and for as many samples that we want. More precisely, here are the steps of the method.

1. Draw a sample $x'$ of $X',$ which we call a *candidate sample;*
2. Compute the *acceptance ratio* $r(x'),$ where
```math
    r(x) = \frac{f(x)}{Mq(x)}.
```
3. Draw a sample $u$ from the uniform distribution $\operatorname{Uniform}(0, 1).$
4. Accept/reject step:
    1. If $u \leq r(x'),$ accept the sample $x'$ as a sample $x=x'$ of the desired random variable $X;$
    2. otherwise, if $u > r(x'),$ reject the sample $x'$ and repeat the process drawing a new candidate and so on, until a candidate sample is accepted.
5. Repeat for as many samples as desired.

How do you check that this really yields samples of $X?$

Let us start with another, but related, question: How often is a candidate sample accepted?

## Expected acceptance rate

First, notice that
```math
    \mathbb{P}(X' \textrm{ is accepted}) = \mathbb{P}\left(U \leq \frac{f(X')}{Mq(X')}\right) = \int_{\{q(x) > 0\}} \mathbb{P}\left( U \leq \frac{f(x)}{Mq(x)} \bigg| X' = x\right) q(x)\;\mathrm{d}x,
```
where the integral is restricted to the region $\{q(x) > 0\}$ since $q(x)$ is the PDF of $X'$ and $\{q(x) > 0\}$ is a carrier of the random variable $X',$ i.e. $q(X') > 0$ almost surely.

The probability of $U$ being less than $f(x)/Mq(x)$ is precisely this ratio, i.e.
```math
    \mathbb{P}\left( U \leq \frac{f(x)}{Mq(x)} \bigg| X' = x\right) = \frac{f(x)}{Mq(x)},
```
again in the region $\{q(x) > 0\}.$ Thus,
```math
    \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{P}(X' \textrm{ is accepted}) & = \int_{\{q(x) > 0\}} \frac{f(x)}{Mq(x)} q(x)\;\mathrm{d}x = \int_{\{q(x) > 0\}} \frac{f(x)}{M} \;\mathrm{d}x \\
        & = \frac{Z}{M} \int_{\{q(x) > 0\}} \frac{f(x)}{Z} \;\mathrm{d}x = \int_{\{q(x) > 0\}} p(x) \;\mathrm{d}x = \frac{Z}{M}.
    \end{align*}
```

Recall that $M$ is the bound on $f$, so that the ratio $Z/M$ is related to the bound on the PDF itself,
```math
    p(x) = \frac{f(x)}{Z} \leq \frac{M}{Z}q(x).
```
Thus, the tighter the bound, the higher the acceptance rate. A poor acceptance rate means we will have to compute a lot of proposed samples and a lot of acceptance checks to obtain a relativaly small portion of actual samples of the desired distribution.

## Distribution of the accepted samples

We may now check the distribution of the accepted samples. This is expressed by the CDF
```math
    F_{X' \textrm{ is accepted}} = \mathbb{P}(X' \leq x | X' \textrm{ is accepted}).
```
This can be computed via
```math
    F_{X' \textrm{ is accepted}} = \mathbb{P}(X' \leq x | X' \textrm{ is accepted}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X' \leq x, \; X' \textrm{ is accepted})}{\mathbb{P}(X' \textrm{ is accepted})}.
```
The numerator is given by
```math
    \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{P}(X' \leq x, \; X' \textrm{ is accepted}) & = \mathbb{P}\left( X' \leq x, \; U \leq \frac{f(X')}{Mq(X')}\right) \\
        & = \int_{\{q(x') > 0, \; x' \leq x\}} \mathbb{P}\left( U \leq \frac{f(x')}{Mq(x')} \right) q(x') \;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \int_{\{q(x') > 0, \; x' \leq x\}} \int_{\{0 \leq u \leq f(x')/Mq(x')\}} q(x') \;\mathrm{d}u \;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \int_{\{q(x') > 0, \; x' \leq x\}} \frac{f(x')}{Mq(x')} q(x')\;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \int_{x'\leq x} \frac{f(x')}{M} \;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \frac{Z}{M}\int_{x'\leq x} \frac{f(x')}{Z} \;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \frac{Z}{M} \int_{-\infty}^x p(x')\;\mathrm{d}x' \\
        & = \frac{Z}{M} F_{X}(x).
    \end{align*}
```
Thus,
```math
    F_{X' \textrm{ is accepted}} = \mathbb{P}(X' \leq x | X' \textrm{ is accepted}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X' \leq x, \; X' \textrm{ is accepted})}{\mathbb{P}(X' \textrm{ is accepted})} = \frac{\frac{Z}{M} F_{X}(x)}{\frac{Z}{M}} = F_{X}(x).
```

In other words, the probability distribution of the accepted samples of $X'$ is precisely the distribution of $X.$

## Numerical example

Let us draw samples from a synthetic distribution with density proportional to a function which is a polynomial with an exponential envelope, of the form
```math
    f(x) = (3x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x)^2e^{-x^2}.
```
```@setup rejectionsampling
using StatsPlots
using Random
using Distributions

rng = Xoshiro(123)
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
f(x) = (3x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x)^2 * exp(-x^2)
xx = -6:0.01:6
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(xx, f, title="Plot of \$f(x)\$", titlefont=10, linewidth=2, legend=false) # hide
```

One can actually compute the normalizing constant we can write
```math
    f(x) = (9x^6 + 12x^5 - 20x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2) e^{-x^2},
```
so that the integral with the odd powers vanish and we are left with
```math
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \;\mathrm{d}x = 9 \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^6 e^{-x^2}\;\mathrm{d}x - 20 \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^4 e^{-x^2}\;\mathrm{d}x + 16 \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 e^{-x^2}\;\mathrm{d}x,
```
and each integral can be seen as multiples of the moments of a normal distribution with zero mean and variance $1/2.$ Thus,
```math
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \;\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2} \left( 9 \mathbb{E}[Y^6] - 20\mathbb{E}[Y^4] + 16\mathbb{E}[Y^2]\right),
```
where $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2),$ $\sigma^2 = 1/2.$ Since
```math
    \mathbb{E}[Y^{2n}] = \sigma^n 2^{-n}(2n)!/n!,
```
we have, in particular,
```math
    \mathbb{E}[Y^6] = 15 \sigma^6 = \frac{15}{8}, \quad \mathbb{E}[Y^6] = 15 \sigma^6 = \frac{3}{4}, \quad \mathbb{E}[Y^2] = 15 \sigma^6 = \frac{1}{2}.
```
Thus,
```math
    Z = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \;\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\pi} \left( 9 \frac{15}{8} - 20\frac{3}{4} + 16\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{79}{8}\sqrt{\pi} \approx 17.50,
```
This is the factor $Z$ in the expression for the density $f=f(x),$
```math
    p(x) = \frac{f(x)}{Z} = \frac{8}{79\sqrt{\pi}}(3x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x)^2e^{-x^2}.
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
Z = 79 * sqrt(pi) / 8
p(x) = f(x) / Z
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="Plots of PDF \$p\$ and proportional function \$f\$ of desired distribution", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, f, linewidth=2, label="f") # hide
plot!(xx, p, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
```

Now we need a bound with respect to the density of an easy distribution to sample. We may take $X'$ to be the standard normal distribution, for which the density is
```math
    q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2},
```
and then we need to find $M$ such that $f(x) \leq M q(x),$ i.e.
```math
    (9x^6 + 12x^5 - 20x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2) e^{-x^2} \leq \frac{M}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}.
```
For that, we first need to compute the maximum values of the terms of the form $x^n e^{-x^2/2}.$ Since the critical points of such a function occur at $x = \pm \sqrt{n},$ we have
```math
    x^n e^{-x^2} \leq n^{n/2} e^{-n/2}e^{-x^2/2},
```
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}.$ With that, and discarding the negative term with even power, we bound
```math
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) & = (9x^6 + 12x^5 - 20x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2)e^{-x^2} \\
        & \leq \sqrt{2\pi}(9 \times 6^3 e^{-3} + 12 \times 5^{5/2} e^{-5/2} + 16 \times 3^{3/2} e^{-3/2} + 16 \times 2 e^{-1})\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}.
    \end{align*}
```
for all $x\in\mathbb{R}.$ Rounding up the coefficient to an integer, we find that
```math
    f(x) \leq 457 q(x),
```
so we take
```math
    M = 457.
```
This bound can be visualized as follows
```@setup rejectionsampling
q(x) = exp(-x^2/2) / sqrt(2Ï€)
M = 457
g(x) = M * q(x)
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="Plot of \$f(x)\$ and \$Mq(x)\$", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, f, label="\$f(x)\$") # hide
plot!(xx, g, label="\$Mq(x)\$") # hide
```

Well, one can see it is a loose bound, which will amount to too many rejections. We should find a tighter bound. Let us look for a bound with respect to the density of a normal distribution with variance $2$ instead of the standard normal. For that, we split the exponential as
```math
    e^{-x^2} = e^{-\frac{3}{4}x^2} e^{-\frac{1}{4}x^2},
```
so the second exponential goes to the PDF $e^{-x^2/4}/\sqrt{4\pi}$ of the distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, 2),$ while the first exponential is used to bound the polynomial part,
```math
    \sqrt{4\pi}(9x^6 + 12x^5 - 20x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2)e^{-\frac{3}{4}x^2} \leq M.
```
Since the critical points of $x^ne^{-3x^2/4}$ occur at $x = \pm \sqrt{2n/3},$ we have
```math
    x^n e^{-\frac{3}{4}x^2} \leq \left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{n/2} e^{-n/2}.
```
Thus,
```math
    \begin{align*}
        & \sqrt{4\pi}(9x^6 + 12x^5 - 20x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2)e^{-\frac{3}{4}x^2} \\
        & \qquad \leq \sqrt{4\pi}(9\times 4^2 e^{-2} + 12 \times \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^{5/2} e^{-5/2} + 16 \times 2^{3/2} e^{-3/2} + 16\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) * e^{-1}),
    \end{align*}
```
so we can take
```math
M = 204
```

We can see this bound is a bit tighter than the previous one, but it is still not tight enough as we can see by the high rate of rejection of more than 90% (the estimated value is $Z/M \approx 0.0858$).
```@setup rejectionsampling
M = 204
variance = 2
Xprime = Normal(0, variance)
q(x) = pdf(Xprime, x)
g(x) = M * q(x)
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="Plot of \$f(x)\$ and \$Mq(x)\$", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, f, label="\$f(x)\$") # hide
plot!(xx, g, label="\$Mq(x)\$") # hide
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
num_proposals = 2_000
proposed_samples = rand(rng, Xprime, num_proposals)
acceptance = f.(proposed_samples) ./ (g.(proposed_samples))
uniform_samples = rand(rng, num_proposals)
acceptance_flag = uniform_samples .â‰¤ ( f.(proposed_samples) ./ g.(proposed_samples) )
accepted_samples = [x for (x,a) in zip(proposed_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling

histogram!(proposed_samples, normalize=:pdf, bins=40, label="histogram") # hide
plot!(xx, q, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
```

```@example rejectionsampling

```

```@setup rejectionsampling
accepted_uniform_samples = [u for (u,a) in zip(uniform_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="comparison of all uniform values and accepted ones\nacceptance ratio: $(round(sum(accepted_samples)/num_proposals, sigdigits=2))", titlefont=10) # hide

scatter!(accepted_samples, accepted_uniform_samples, markersize=2, label="accepted") # hide
```

We can certainly improve acceptance rate by looking for a tighter bound. A numerical investigation reveals that we can apparently take $M$ as low as $88.$
```math
    \max_{-6 \leq x \leq 6} \left(\frac{f(x)}{q(x)}\right) \approx 87.5.
```
Using this bound, the expected acceptance rate is $Z \approx 17.50 / 88 \approx 0.1989,$ so we more than double the acceptance rate, and we have a better approximation of the distribution.

```@setup rejectionsampling
M = 88
g(x) = M * q(x)
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="Plot of \$f(x)\$ and \$Mq(x)\$", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, f, label="\$f(x)\$") # hide
plot!(xx, g, label="\$Mq(x)\$") # hide
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
M = 88
proposed_samples = rand(rng, Xprime, num_proposals)
acceptance = f.(proposed_samples) ./ (g.(proposed_samples))
uniform_samples = rand(rng, num_proposals)
acceptance_flag = uniform_samples .â‰¤ ( f.(proposed_samples) ./ g.(proposed_samples) )
accepted_samples = [x for (x,a) in zip(proposed_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="histogram of proposed samples and PDF of proposal random variable", titlefont=10) # hide
histogram!(proposed_samples, normalize=:pdf, bins=40, label="histogram") # hide
plot!(xx, q, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
```

```@example rejectionsampling

plot!(xx, p, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
accepted_uniform_samples = [u for (u,a) in zip(uniform_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="comparison of all uniform values and accepted ones\nacceptance ratio: $(round(sum(accepted_samples)/num_proposals, sigdigits=2))", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, x -> f(x) / maximum(f.(xx)), linewidth=2, alpha=0.5, label="f/max(f)") # hide
plot!(xx, x -> f(x) / g(x), linewidth=2, label="ratio") # hide
scatter!(proposed_samples, uniform_samples, markersize=2, alpha=0.2, label="uniform") # hide
scatter!(accepted_samples, accepted_uniform_samples, markersize=2, label="accepted") # hide
```

We can improve the sampling process much more by working with a normal distribution centered on the mean value obtained from $f,$ which seems to be near $x = 1.68.$

```@setup rejectionsampling
mu = 1.6
Xprime = Normal(mu, variance)
q(x) = pdf(Xprime, x)
M = maximum(f.(xx) ./ q.(xx))
g(x) = M * q(x)
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="Plot of \$f(x)\$ and \$Mq(x)\$", titlefont=10) # hide
plot!(xx, f, label="\$f(x)\$") # hide
plot!(xx, g, label="\$Mq(x)\$") # hide
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
proposed_samples = rand(rng, Xprime, num_proposals)
acceptance = f.(proposed_samples) ./ (g.(proposed_samples))
uniform_samples = rand(rng, num_proposals)
acceptance_flag = uniform_samples .â‰¤ ( f.(proposed_samples) ./ g.(proposed_samples) )
accepted_samples = [x for (x,a) in zip(proposed_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling
plot(title="histogram of proposed samples and PDF of proposal random variable", titlefont=10) # hide
histogram!(proposed_samples, normalize=:pdf, bins=40, label="histogram") # hide
plot!(xx, q, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
vline!([mu], label="mean")
```

```@example rejectionsampling

histogram!(accepted_samples, normalize=:pdf, bins=40, label="histogram") # hide
plot!(xx, p, linewidth=2, label="pdf") # hide
```

```@setup rejectionsampling
accepted_uniform_samples = [u for (u,a) in zip(uniform_samples, acceptance_flag) if a]
```

```@example rejectionsampling

scatter!(proposed_samples, uniform_samples, markersize=2, alpha=0.2, label="uniform") # hide
